# LearnGermanGame

This program creates a GUI application geared for pre-school children. This application teaches the user words in German and then tests them on their knowledge.

The <strong>Words</strong> class creates the lists of German to English words. It then generates an ArrayList of random word options for the quiz sections, and sets the matching answer.

The <strong>LearnGermanGame</strong> class generates the game layout. There is one frame for learning the words, and a second frame for quizzing the user.
